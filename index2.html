            <h2>Dumbbell Fly</h2>
            <p>The Dumbbell Fly is a classic chest exercise that targets the pectoral muscles, helping to develop chest width and strength. This movement mimics a hugging motion, allowing for a deep stretch and contraction in the chest muscles.</p>
            <h3>Technique</h3>
            <p>Lie flat on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing each other. Keep a slight bend in your elbows and lower the weights to the sides, creating a wide arc. Stretch until you feel a deep stretch in your chest, then bring the dumbbells back to the starting position. Maintain control and avoid letting the weights touch at the top.</p>
            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <p>This exercise increases chest width and definition, improves shoulder stability, and engages secondary muscles such as the shoulders and triceps.</p>
